# Spicy-Group-Project

HERE IS THE PLAN:
Set up Heroku Website.
Make a site map of how we want the site to look and operate.
A hub for Hihi to create individual profiles that includes an image, name and Bio.These are linked on a single page that displays each profile that the users can then click on and explore. Users can also edit their own profile.

First Page:
The mural of all the profiles that have been submitted to the website.
This page also contains a create profile button.




Second page:
Submission page.
This contains a form that holds an image slot, name slot and Bio slot.
At the bottom of the page there will be a submission button.
